/**

 *
 * Provides automatic hookup and initialization of GSAP. There are several unique resources available in this sub-path
 * export that makes GSAP even easier to use including support for `TJSPosition`. In particular, {@link GsapCompose}
 * is a powerful way to construct GSAP animations declaratively in a data oriented manner and supports hooking up and
 * controlling `TJSPosition`. There also is a Svelte action to hook up dragging support {@link draggableGsap}.
