/**
 * Provides legacy support for Handlebars rendering while still gaining aspects of reactivity with a Svelte powered
 * application shell. You may use the resources in this package in a similar manner as the core Foundry
 * {@link Application} / {@link FormApplication} classes. This should only be an interim or stepwise solution as you
 * convert your package over to fully using TRL & Svelte.
