The TyphonJS Runtime Library (TRL) is an integrated library and framework for creating modern Svelte powered packages 
for the [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/) platform; a TTRPG (table top role playing game) virtual tabletop.

There are many useful libraries and original code brought together that extend the power of Svelte to provide a 
cohesive modern runtime library for advanced package development. Some of the highlights are an optimized and reactive 
desktop like GUI framework, but there is much more to explore as well.

In the near future TRL will be available for open web app development on top of SvelteKit and Svelte in general.

I will be adding many examples to the TRL API docs in the coming months along with a forthcoming developer guide / 
tutorial. For now the best way to receive assistance and getting started with TRL is to join the 
[TyphonJS Discord](https://typhonjs.io/discord/) server where you can ask questions about Foundry VTT, Svelte, and TRL.

The API docs are available here: https://typhonjs-fvtt-lib.github.io/api-docs

A demo repo / package (requires Foundry VTT) is available here:
