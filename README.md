The TyphonJS Runtime Library (TRL) is an integrated library and framework for creating modern Svelte powered packages 
for the [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/) platform; a TTRPG (table top role playing game) virtual table top.

There are many useful libraries and original code that is bundled together to provide a cohesive modern runtime library 
for advanced package development. Some of the highlights are an optimized desktop like GUI framework, but there is much 
more to explore as well.

In the near future TRL will be available for open web app development on top of SvelteKit and Svelte in general.

I will be adding many examples to the TRL API docs in the coming months along with a forthcoming developer guide / 
tutorial. At this present stage the API docs cover the entire ESM code and packages available. Documentation for the 
Svelte components contained in TRL is forthcoming.

The API docs are available here: https://typhonjs-fvtt-lib.github.io/api-docs

A demo package (requires Foundry VTT) is available here:
